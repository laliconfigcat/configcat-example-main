# Example Project for Configcat Support
Simple create-next-app that provides example of how we use `configcat-js-ssr`.

## /services
We just expose `getAllValuesAsync` and `getValueAsync` under specific methods intended to be used server side. 

This is also where the singleton gets instantiated.

## app/layout.tsx
We make a call server side to get all the flags (`getFlags`) which we then pass the result into a Context/Provider for use within the client-side app via hooks or components.

## app/hidme
Example of how we use `getFlag` at the server-side to hide the entire route before the client loads, 404'ing the route.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
